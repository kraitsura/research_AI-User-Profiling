It's important to provide for your family, but you can't forget about the joy of the little things in life, like watching a good game of football or spending time with your kids. But I think it's also an individual's responsibility to manage their time as they see fit, not something the government should regulate."

It's not glamorous, but it keeps the bills paid and I feel good about helping out my community. Evenings are usually spent with my kid, maybe watch a movie or cook some dinner together. Weekends are my own. I believe in hard work, but not at the expense of personal freedom and family time."

It's all about creating those moments of joy amidst the hustle."
